# Event Management Application

This project involves creating a basic task management application using
PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The task is to build a web page where users
can register a new account, login, change account password, view, add,
edit, and delete events.

The exercise is structured in the following parts - detailed in more detail
below.

1. Creation of a login page
2. Display of a specific field/event after login
3. Creation of a registration form (for unregistered users)
4. Changing a password by sending a link to the email
5. View, add, edit and delete events
6. BONUS: Send email when events are added or edited

## Caution !!

The application does not involve the use of any frameworks. The use of a framework such as
Laravel or Symphony, Bootstrap, React JS amounts to the rejection of the project.
In this regard, the code was purly written in HTML, CSS, PHP (with objects or classes preferred)
and JavaScript.

## Architecture

The application uses the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture or pattern. Below are amongst some of the benefits of
the MVC architecture;

- Seperation of concern
- Modularity
- Scalability
- Code Resuse, etc
